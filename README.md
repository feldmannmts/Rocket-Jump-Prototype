# Rocket-Jump-Prototype

This study project focuses on learning more about C# and .NET framework.
To do that, I'm using the Godot Game Engine, an open-source game engine focused on creating games in 3D and 2D.
The reach my objective, I'm translating scripts in GDScript (Godot Game Engine Language) to C#/.NET supported by Godot.

Here we have an example of that translation.

And my secondary objective with this project is to create an FPS Platformer game, focused on speed and extremely complex movements using the famous mechanic "Rocket Jump".
